The [Data](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/school-reports/) comes from Florida Department of Health.  They release several reports throughout the years that list the number of postive covid-19 cases by school.  The school types include Elementary, Middle, High School, Charter/Prepatory Schools, and University/Colleges.  The data is presented on a pdf, is in wide format, and data is not labeled by school type.

Also, the version of Tableau that is being used is Tableau Public.  This means that the data that is export will need to be in excel format.
